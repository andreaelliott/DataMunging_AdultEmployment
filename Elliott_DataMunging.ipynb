Doing so would lead to a nearly 50% increase in the mode, making it by far the most common entry, when at this point, other entries are not far behind. For 'Occupation', I will leave the unknown as its own category. Interestingly, there is no option of 'unemployed' or 'stay at home parent'.

Perhaps the people in the lower income category tend to be in hourly jobs and therefore don't exceed 40 hours per week, while the people in the higher income category are salaried and are more likely to work extra hours. Alternatively, it could be that those people in the higher income back who are working hourly jobs may be putting in overtime to reach that higher income level. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The second and third aggregate function I ran under this subcategory was looking at the minimum and maximum entries. I found that regardless of income level, the minimum and maximum reported hours of work are 1 and 99, respectively. That led me to look at minimum and maximum age as a function of Hours per Week, as well as the number of people who reported each value for Hours per Week. Above we only see the lowest and highest reports, but that's fine with me because I think those are interesting to consider. First, we're seeing that the maximum ages for those working 1-5 hours per week are 80s and 90s. This make sense, as elderly people may be working just a few hours for something to do. At the same time, I think a healthy skepticism is warranted for those ~90 people reporting 1-3 hours per week. Why would a business keep that 21 year old on payroll for 1 hour per week? Did that person just fill in 1 hour because there was no option for 0 hours? I am also skeptical of those reporting >96 hours per week, which would be about 14 hours of work seven days per week. Is it possible? yes. But is it likely for any length of time? No. However, it's also possible that people are counting other things in their hours of work (e.g., household obligations, etc). What about that 90 year old reporting 99 hours of work per week? I would make a strong claim that that isn't a valid data point."
